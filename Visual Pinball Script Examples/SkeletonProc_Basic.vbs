'************************************
' What you need to add to your table
'************************************

' a timer called CollisionTimer. With a fast interval, like from 1 to 10
' one collision sound, in this script is called fx_collide
' as many sound files as max number of balls, with names ending with 0, 1, 2, 3, etc
' for ex. as used in this script: fx_ballrolling0, fx_ballrolling1, fx_ballrolling2, fx_ballrolling3, etc


'******************************************
' Explanation of the rolling sound routine
'******************************************

' sounds are played based on the ball speed and position

' the routine checks first for deleted balls and stops the rolling sound.

' The For loop goes through all the balls on the table and checks for the ball speed and 
' if the ball is on the table (height lower than 30) then then it plays the sound
' otherwise the sound is stopped, like when the ball has stopped or is on a ramp or flying.

' The sound is played using the VOL, PAN and PITCH functions, so the volume and pitch of the sound
' will change according to the ball speed, and the PAN function will change the stereo position according
' to the position of the ball on the table.


'**************************************
' Explanation of the collision routine
'**************************************

' The Double For loop: This is a double cycle used to check the collision between a ball and the other ones.
' If you look at the parameters of both cycles, youâ€™ll notice they are designed to avoid checking 
' collision twice. For example, I will never check collision between ball 2 and ball 1, 
' because I already checked collision between ball 1 and 2. So, if we have 4 balls, 
' the collision checks will be: ball 1 with 2, 1 with 3, 1 with 4, 2 with 3, 2 with 4 and 3 with 4.

' Sum first the radius of both balls, and if the height between them is higher then do not calculate anything more,
' since the balls are on different heights so they can't collide.

' The next 3 lines calculates distance between xth and yth balls with the Pytagorean theorem,

' The first "If": Checking if the distance between the two balls is less than the sum of the radius of both balls, 
' and both balls are not already colliding.

' Why are we checking if balls are already in collision? 
' Because we do not want the sound repeting when two balls are resting closed to each other.

' Set the collision property of both balls to True, and we assign the number of the ball colliding

' Play the collide sound of your choice using the VOL, PAN and PITCH functions

' Last lines: If the distance between 2 balls is more than the radius of a ball,
' then there is no collision and then set the collision property of the ball to False (-1).
